## Visualize module
Visualize module is cloned from https://github.com/junming259/Partial_Point_Clouds_Generation and there are some changes:
#### run in .py
Argument *shrun* of functions allows you to run codes out of command lines.
#### no angle correction
Argument *oriangle* of functions allows you to extract points without angle correction and visualize it with original angle.
However, remember that if you extract points without correction, you should visualize it without correction as well.
